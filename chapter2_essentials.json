    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach in the CAR framework?",
    "answer": "IRB is a methodology allowing banks to use internal models to estimate credit risk parameters (PD, LGD, EAD) to calculate regulatory capital requirements more risk-sensitively."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Differentiate between the Foundation IRB (F-IRB) and Advanced IRB (A-IRB) approaches.",
    "answer": "F-IRB requires banks to use supervisory estimates for LGD and EAD while estimating PD internally; A-IRB allows banks to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD internally."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "Why is the IRB approach considered more risk-sensitive than the Standardized Approach?",
    "answer": "Because it uses internal risk estimates (PD, LGD, EAD) for each exposure, reflecting the actual risk profile rather than fixed risk weights."
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "What are the minimum requirements for a bank to use the IRB approach?",
    "answer": "Banks must have robust internal rating systems, historical data, risk management practices, and supervisory approval."
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "question": "Explain the concept of Probability of Default (PD) and its role in IRB.",
    "answer": "PD is the likelihood that a borrower defaults within a one-year horizon; it is a key input for capital calculation in IRB."
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "question": "Explain Loss Given Default (LGD) and how it affects risk-weighted assets (RWA).",
    "answer": "LGD is the proportion of exposure expected to be lost if default occurs; higher LGD increases RWA and capital requirements."
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What is Exposure at Default (EAD) and why is it critical for IRB calculations?",
    "answer": "EAD is the total value the bank is exposed to at the time of default; it directly scales the capital requirement."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "Define the term 'Maturity adjustment' in the IRB context.",
    "answer": "Maturity adjustment accounts for the effect of the remaining term of an exposure on its credit risk, affecting RWA."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "How does the concept of downturn LGD differ from through-the-cycle LGD?",
    "answer": "Downturn LGD reflects losses in adverse economic conditions, whereas through-the-cycle LGD averages losses across the credit cycle."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "question": "List the main asset classes recognized under IRB for credit risk.",
    "answer": "Corporate, sovereign, bank, retail (mortgage, qualifying revolving, other), and equity exposures."
  },
  {
    "id": 11,
    "question": "How are corporate exposures treated differently from retail exposures under IRB?",
    "answer": "Corporate exposures use a formula incorporating PD, LGD, EAD, and correlation; retail exposures are often segmented and use lower correlation factors."
  },
  {
    "id": 12,
    "question": "What special rules apply to sovereign exposures under IRB?",
    "answer": "Sovereign exposures have low correlation and may have different supervisory risk weights; many use fixed supervisory estimates for LGD."
  },
  {
    "id": 13,
    "question": "How are secured exposures, such as mortgages, treated under IRB?",
    "answer": "Secured exposures may use collateral-adjusted LGD, reducing RWA if the collateral value is sufficient and recognized."
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "question": "Explain the treatment of equity exposures in IRB calculations.",
    "answer": "Equity exposures are usually risk-weighted separately, often with higher capital requirements due to higher volatility and correlation."
  },
  {
    "id": 15,
    "question": "How are unrated exposures handled if a bank uses IRB?",
    "answer": "Unrated exposures require the bank to assign internal ratings consistent with its rating system and supervisory guidelines."
  },
  {
    "id": 16,
    "question": "What is the general formula for calculating RWA under the IRB approach?",
    "answer": "RWA = Risk-weight function(PD, LGD, EAD, Maturity) × 12.5, reflecting the capital requirement scaling."
  },
  {
    "id": 17,
    "question": "How is capital requirement calculated for corporate exposure using F-IRB?",
    "answer": "Capital = RWA × 8%; RWA is derived from PD, LGD (supervisory), EAD, maturity, and correlation factors."
  },
  {
    "id": 18,
    "question": "Explain how the risk-weight function varies with PD, LGD, EAD, and maturity.",
    "answer": "Higher PD, LGD, EAD, or longer maturity increases the calculated RWA and thus capital requirement."
  },
  {
    "id": 19,
    "question": "How does the correlation factor differ across corporate, sovereign, and retail exposures?",
    "answer": "Corporates have correlation based on PD, sovereigns typically low fixed correlation, and retail exposures have lower, often fixed correlations."
  },
  {
    "id": 20,
    "question": "Describe how capital requirements change for highly rated vs. lower-rated exposures.",
    "answer": "Highly rated exposures have lower PD, thus lower capital; low-rated exposures have higher PD and higher capital requirements."
  },
  {
    "id": 21,
    "question": "What are the main limitations of the IRB approach?",
    "answer": "Dependence on internal models, data quality issues, low-default portfolios, and potential underestimation of risk in downturns."
  },
  {
    "id": 22,
    "question": "How does OSFIS CAR ensure that IRB models remain conservative?",
    "answer": "Through supervisory floors, mandatory downturn LGD, model validation, and periodic review of assumptions."
  },
  {
    "id": 23,
    "question": "Explain the role of supervisory validation in the IRB approach.",
    "answer": "Supervisors verify that banks’ rating systems, models, and data meet regulatory standards and produce reliable capital estimates."
  },
  {
    "id": 24,
    "question": "What are the potential pitfalls of relying solely on internal models for PD/LGD?",
    "answer": "Models may underestimate risk, especially in low-default portfolios or unusual economic conditions, leading to insufficient capital."
  },
  {
    "id": 25,
    "question": "Under what circumstances might a bank be required to revert to the Standardized Approach?",
    "answer": "If internal models are unreliable, data is insufficient, or supervisory approval is withdrawn."
  },
  {
    "id": 26,
    "question": "How are credit risk mitigation techniques integrated into IRB calculations?",
    "answer": "Collateral, guarantees, and netting can reduce LGD or EAD, lowering RWA if recognized under CAR rules."
  },
  {
    "id": 27,
    "question": "What is the treatment of purchased receivables or off-balance-sheet items?",
    "answer": "They are converted to credit exposure equivalents using supervisory or internal estimates before applying IRB risk weights."
  },
  {
    "id": 28,
    "question": "Explain how IRB handles low-default portfolios.",
    "answer": "Banks use conservative PD estimates, floors, and expert judgment to compensate for limited historical data."
  },
  {
    "id": 29,
    "question": "What are the reporting and documentation requirements for IRB models?",
    "answer": "Banks must maintain model documentation, validation reports, data histories, and supervisory submissions regularly."
  },
  {
    "id": 30,
    "question": "How do model adjustments for downturn conditions impact capital requirements?",
    "answer": "Downturn adjustments increase LGD and correlation factors, raising RWA and capital to cover stressed losses."
