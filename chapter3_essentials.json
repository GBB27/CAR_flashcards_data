  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "Why is operational risk considered distinct from credit and market risk?",

  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What are the components of the Standardized Approach?",

    "answer": "To ensure that institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb losses from operational risk and maintain financial stability."
  },
  {
    "id": 17,
    "question": "How often must operational risk data be updated?",
    "answer": "Loss data and BI components should be updated at least annually, with internal reviews and validation to ensure accuracy."
  },
  {
    "id": 18,
    "question": "What is the role of internal loss data versus external data?",
    "answer": "Internal loss data reflects the institution’s own experience, while external data can supplement for low-frequency high-severity events."
  },
  {
    "id": 19,
    "question": "What is the significance of thresholds in loss data collection?",
    "answer": "Thresholds ensure that minor losses are captured only if relevant while focusing on material operational risk events for capital calculation."
  },
  {
    "id": 20,
    "question": "What is a Business Indicator (BI)?",
    "answer": "A financial proxy of the size and complexity of an institution, including income components, used to calculate operational risk capital."
  },
  {
    "id": 21,
    "question": "How is the Business Indicator divided for the Standardized Approach?",
    "answer": "Into interest, leases, fees, commissions, and other operating income, with each component mapped to business lines and beta factors."
  },
  {
    "id": 22,
    "question": "What is the role of beta factors in the TSA?",
    "answer": "Beta factors scale the business indicator components to reflect the relative operational risk intensity of each business line."
  },
  {
    "id": 23,
    "question": "What types of events are considered extraordinary and excluded from operational risk calculations?",
    "answer": "Events that are unusual, non-recurring, or not indicative of the institution’s normal operational risk exposure."
  },
  {
    "id": 24,
