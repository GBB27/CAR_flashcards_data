    "question": "What is the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach in the CAR framework?",
    "answer": "A credit risk assessment method allowing institutions to use internal models to estimate risk parameters (PD, LGD, EAD, M) for calculating regulatory capital."

  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "What are the minimum requirements for using the IRB approach?",

  },
  {
    "id": 16,
    "question": "How are unrated exposures treated under IRB?",
    "answer": "They are assessed using internal estimates of PD, LGD, and other IRB parameters instead of external credit ratings."
  },
  {
    "id": 17,
    "question": "What is the formula for Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) under IRB?",
    "answer": "RWA = 12.5 × K × EAD, where K is the capital requirement derived from PD, LGD, EAD, and M."
  },
  {
    "id": 18,
    "question": "How is capital requirement calculated under the Foundation IRB approach for corporates?",
    "answer": "Banks estimate PD, while OSFI provides LGD, EAD, and M; these inputs are used in the IRB risk-weight function to determine K."
  },
  {
    "id": 19,
    "question": "How does the correlation factor vary across asset classes in IRB?",
    "answer": "Correlation is higher for large corporate exposures and lower for retail portfolios, reflecting different levels of systemic risk."
  },
  {
    "id": 20,
    "question": "What happens to capital requirements when PD increases?",
    "answer": "Capital requirements rise because higher default risk increases expected and unexpected losses."
  },
  {
    "id": 21,
    "question": "What are the main limitations of the IRB approach?",
    "answer": "Complexity, reliance on internal data, potential model risk, and high implementation costs."
  },
  {
    "id": 22,

  },
  {
    "id": 23,
    "question": "What is the role of supervisory validation in IRB?",
    "answer": "To ensure models meet regulatory standards, are conceptually sound, and produce reliable risk estimates."
