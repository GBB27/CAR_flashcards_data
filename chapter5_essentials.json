  {
    "id": 20,
    "question": "What is the formula for Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) under IRB?",

  {
    "id": 21,
    "question": "How is capital requirement calculated under the Foundation IRB approach for corporates?",
    "answer": "Banks estimate PD, while OSFI provides LGD, EAD, and M; these inputs are used in the IRB risk-weight function to determine K."

  },
  {
    "id": 23,
