    "question": "What is the risk weight for exposures with a long-term rating based on external ratings?",
    "answer": "It depends on the external rating grade or an available inferred rating."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the SEC-ERBA?",
    "answer": "To determine risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures that are externally rated."

  {
    "id": 237,
    "question": "What happens to the risk weight when A is less than KIRB and D is less than or equal to KIRB?",
    "answer": "The risk weight is assigned based on the weighted average of 1,250% and the calculated risk weight."
